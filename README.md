# project1

This project is created as part of the Udacity Grow with Google Front-end Web Developer Nanodegree Scholarship program. 

The goal of the project was to use the HTML and CSS skills learned so far in the program to create a Portfolio site. 

I am using the parallax technique for the background and the three main cards are using flex to organize content. The content is made responsive using media queries for mobile devices.
